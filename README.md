# Chinese Character Learning App

## Overview

This project was built with the goal of aiding learners of the Chinese language. It is said that knowing around 3000 characters allows one to read and understand most of the Chinese language. This application aims to provide an interactive and engaging way to learn and practice these characters.

## Data Source

The data for this application is sourced from the [CC-CEdict project](https://cc-cedict.org/wiki/). CC-CEdict is a continuation of the CEDICT project started by Paul Denisowski in 1997 with the aim to provide a complete Chinese to English dictionary with pronunciation in Pinyin for the Chinese characters.

A special thanks to the developer of the [cc-cedict-structurizer](https://github.com/SilentByte/cc-cedict-structurizer/tree/7858cc1bcb4c4f115dcd9ef26756108671ba026f/cc-cedict) project, from which we have parsed and taken the data for this application.

## Character List

The list of characters used in this application is based on the collation by the [Mandarin Blueprint](https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/) website. We acknowledge their effort in creating a comprehensive list that serves as a solid foundation for any Chinese language learner.

## Usage

To use this application, simply open the app on [https://francislainy.github.io/hanzi-3000/](https://francislainy.github.io/hanzi-3000/). Start your journey by clicking the characters that you know. After you've gone through all the characters, check your results to see how many characters you've learned. Happy learning!
